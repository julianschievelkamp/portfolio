    about: (
        <>
            Julian Schievelkamp (b. 1994) is a contemporary visual artist and
            fine art photographer based in Cologne, Germany. Using both analog
            film and digital techniques, his recent work emphasizes on the
            synergies of classic photography and virtual realities of computer
            generated imagery (CGI). Synaesthetic experiences, whose sensory
            impressions merge into one picture, have had a great influence on
            his way of working.
            <br />

            2017 Prix de la Photographie Paris. In 2019 the artist was awarded
            the title <i>Fine Art Photographer of the Year</i> by the jury of
            the 5th Fine Art Photography Awards. Julian Schievelkamp exhibited
            his work in London, Berlin and Cologne and over 100 YellowKorner
